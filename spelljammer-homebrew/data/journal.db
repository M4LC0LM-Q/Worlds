The driver tips their tall hat to you, their pallor stark against their long, well-kept tresses of orange hair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">~ Found in the amazing TTRPG supplement <i><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vineyardttrpg/the-vineyard-project?ref=8dq8wi\">The Vineyard</a></i></p>","format":1},"_id":"Hsjk9TVNK8TzFNNa","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Image","type":"image","src":"https://dscryb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AstralSea.webp","_id":"2xRiZqODYotESUQj","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"DxCaIvDMuaZ0YVcK":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.12.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1685271639927,"modifiedTime":1685271639927,"lastModifiedBy":"DxCaIvDMuaZ0YVcK"},"_id":"Uy6A7Kl27VEmg3RS"}

These bonuses stack against outsiders who are both chaotic and evil (maximum +12) . If you don’t have the ability to cast spells, you instead gain the ability to use <em>protection from chaos/evil </em>as a spell-like ability three times per day.<br /><strong>3: Wrath of the Inheritor (Su)</strong> Three times per day, you can call upon Iomedae during the casting of a spell to increase its potency. When you use this ability, you can cast any spell that deals hit point damage and has a casting time of 1 standard action as a full-round action instead. Doing so changes half the damage dealt to divine power, similar to a <em>flame strike </em>spell. For example, a wizard 5/evangelist 9 casts a <em>lightning bolt </em>as a full-round action. The spell deals 10d6 points of damage, half of which is electricity damage and the other half of which is divine energy and not subject to electricity resistance. If you can’t cast spells that deal hit point damage, you instead gain the ability to imbue your weapon with holy power. Three times per day as a free action, you can grant your weapon the <em>holy</em> weapon special ability for 1 minute.</span></p><p></p><p>Exalted</p><p><span>1: Glorious Servant (Sp) <em>shield of faith </em>3/day, <em>enthrall </em>2/day, or <em>searing light </em>1/day<br />2: Righteous Strike (Sp) Once per day, you can channel the effects of <em>holy smite </em>through your weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. On a hit, the target is affected as if targeted with <em>holy smite</em>.<br />3: Just Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a shield archon (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 </em>31). The shield archon follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home in Heaven. The shield archon doesn’t follow commands that would violate its alignment, however, and particularly egregious commands could cause it to attack you.</span></p><p></p><p>Sentinel</p><p><span><strong>1: Knight of Valor (Sp)</strong> <em>bless weapon </em>3/day, <em>bull’s strength </em>2/day, or <em>magic vestment </em>1/day<br /><strong>2: Valorous Smite (Su)</strong> If you have the smite evil class feature, you gain an extra use of that ability per day. You add the levels of sentinel to your paladin levels when calculating the extra damage dealt by your smite. If you successfully deal damage with your smite, your target must succeed at a Will saving throw (with a DC equal to 10 + your Charisma modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice) or be stunned for 1 round plus 1 round for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). Once a target saves against this stunning effect, it is immune to the stunning effect from your holy smite for 24 hours.<br /><br />If you don’t have the smite evil class feature, instead you can, as a free action, single out an outsider with the evil subtype or an evil-aligned dragon you plan to vanquish. Against this target, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls and a sacred bonus equal to your sentinel level on damage rolls. The bonuses remain until the target is dead or you use this ability again, whichever comes first. If you choose a target that is not one of the listed creature types, the ability is wasted. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum once per day).<br /><strong>3: Banishing Strike (Sp)</strong> Once per day, you can channel the effects of <em>banishment </em>through your weapon, though you don’t need to cast (or even know) the spell. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. On a hit, the target is affected by a <em>banishment </em>effect. If you openly wear a holy symbol of Iomedae, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target’s spell resistance (if any) and the saving throw DC increases by 2.</span></p><p></p><p>Paladin</p><p><span>The paladins of Iomedae are just and strong, crusaders who live for the joy of righteous battle.
